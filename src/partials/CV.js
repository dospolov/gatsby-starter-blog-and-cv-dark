            Morozov Delivery Manager I've worked with or around Marat at N-iX for about a
            year and I've been consistently impressed with his passion and drive for
            quality software. He strives for excellence in all he does is able to build
            quality into everything he works on. Moreover, we've been working together on
            several projects before N-iX and Marat led all of them to a production-ready
            solution that was scalable and ready to bring value to the business. As a
            Technical Lead Marat was able to take the idea from Stakeholders, introduce
            decomposition and deliver the end-solution. He was responsible for technical
            excellence and people management within the team. He guided everyone towards
            one end goal! Nikolay Mirkula Software Engineer Marat is an amazing
            professional, who brings all of the skills and expertise in programming and
            web development. His productivity and ambition sets a great example for the
            rest of the team. It was indeed a wonderful thing to work with him as the Lead
            Frontend Engineer at Moqod company. As a colleague, I recommend him to other
            institutions who may want to hire his most treasured skills Michael Sebastiyan

            and find a solution for them. I would be happy to work with him again in the
            future. Dospolov.com © 2020
